# Alamat ng Kadiliman at Kasamaan

This project was developed as part of our CS173: Game Application Development course. The goal was to develop a fully functional 3D game app that can be showcased and played by other students. It should also demonstrate a strong understanding of game design principles, programming techniques, and user experience design.

## Game Overview

The game Alamat ng Kadiliman at Kasamaan revolves around a determined farmer who vows to avenge his family and rescue his wife, who has been kidnapped by the mythical creature Tikbalang. The Tikbalang, driven by a desire for vengeance, forces the farmer’s wife to become his eternal companion as part of his retribution against humans. This act of revenge is rooted in the Tikbalang's fury over the destruction of the elemental kingdoms that lie hidden in the heart of the forest, a sacred realm that humans have long exploited and desecrated. The farmer’s journey is one of relentless courage and resilience, as he faces countless challenges, navigates through dark, enchanted realms, and battles the wrath of the Tikbalang and its minions.
